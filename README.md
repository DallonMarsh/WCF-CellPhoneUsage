# WCF-CellPhoneUsageTest project for WCF - Dallon MarshI developed the App using Eclipse. The User interface is in the client folder and has a screen to display the data for a selected year and a print button.The Business Logic is in the Server folder in the cellPhoneSessionBean class.The Data Access Object is also in the Server folder and is called CellPhoneDAO.There are 3 POJO's in the Shared Folder that contains the data objects.I would normally start writting test cases at this point. I usually use testng but JUnit is fine too. I also like to go back and refactorand add comments and to make sure the classes are organized the same and that the error handling is all there. If you want to ask me anything feel free to call me at 435-681-0071. Thanks.
